		<h2>Is It A Font Or A Typeface?</h2>
		<p>Let’s talk about the elephant in the room first. Font vs typeface, what’s the difference? Which is correct?
			The
			terms typeface and font are sometimes used interchangeably which can be a little confusing.
		</p>
		<aside class="pull_quote">
			<p>
				A <b>typeface</b> is a collection of <b>fonts</b> while a font refers to a specific style or weight
				within a
				typeface family.
			</p>
		</aside>
		<p>
			So let’s put this context with an example. Helvetica is a typeface. But Helvetica Bold is a specific font
			within
			the Helvetica typeface family. Here’s a visual example, so you can see the difference between a typeface and
			fonts.</p>

		<h2>What Is Typography?</h2>
		<p>Now that we understand what a typeface and a font are, what is typography? Typography is the art and
			technique of
			arranging type. Whether you’re designing a website, an app, or a poster, you’re using type to deliver a
			message.
			<br>
			Typography serves two main purposes. The first is it must be legible. Can a user read and understand it? The
			second is how you use typography to create a mood or design aesthetic to attract a specific audience.
			<br>
			Learning the fundamental rules of type, so you can break them later, will help you become a better designer.
			It
			just takes practice and a little knowledge. If you want to learn more about type and how it relates to
			design,

	<h2>Categories Of Type</h2>
	<p>In order to know how to choose fonts, we need to understand the various categories of type, the characteristics
		of
		each, and recommended usage. In this guide, we’ll refer to three different categories of type when choosing font
		pairings.</p>
	<div class="right">
		<img src="images/font_types.png" alt="examples of serif, sans-serif, and decorative fonts">
		<h3>Serif Typefaces</h3>
		<p>A serif is a small line or stroke attached to the end of a larger stroke, often referred to as the “feet”
			shown
			at the bottom of letters. </p>
		<aside class="pull_quote">
			<p><b>Not all serifs are equal.</b></p>
		</aside>
		<p>
			Some have slight variations depending on the typeface and that is part of what makes them unique. An
			advantage
			of using serif typefaces is how many font weights they usually have within a family. One serif family might
			have
			a regular, italics, semi bold, semi bold italic, bold, bold italic, small caps, and more.
			<br>
			Serif typefaces are more formal and traditional. They’re often used editorially such as in newspapers,
			magazines, and the body copy of books. One of the most well-known serif typefaces and probably the first
			font
			you ever used on a computer is Times New Roman.</p>

		<h3>Sans Serif Typefaces</h3>
		<p>Sans serif typefaces do not have serifs (the French word sans, means “without”). These typefaces are more
			modern,
			bold, and great for eye-catching headlines. One of the most popular sans serif typefaces is Arial which is a
			copycat of Helvetica. Our main brand fonts here at Flux are two san serif typefaces.</p>

		<h3>Decorative Typefaces</h3>
		<p>This category of typeface should be used sparingly, most for titles and headlines. It can range from scripts
			to
			monotype, and anything in between. These are a great way to add character to your design but should be
			avoided
			for long paragraphs of body copy as they can be difficult to read.</p>
	</div>

	<h2>Tips For Choosing Fonts</h2>
	<p>We’ve discussed what typography is as well as some of the main categories of type, now let’s dive into tips for
		how
		to choose the best fonts.</p>

	<div class="left">
		<h3>Start With Inspiration</h3>
		<img src="images/typography_tips.png" alt="typography examples for each of the tips listed">
		<p>An important part of the design process is research and inspiration. One of my favorite places to find design
			inspiration is on Pinterest. Let’s say I’m working on designing a poster to advertise an event. On
			Pinterest, I
			searched for “bold poster design” and this is what I found. There’s a lot of fun typefaces that might
			inspire
			the next one you use for your design.
			<br>
			Notice from this moodboard, how type really influences the mood of the design. For more tips on why
			typography
			is important in design, <a

					target="blank">check
				out this article to learn more.</a></p>

		<h3>Choose Your Main Font First</h3>
		<p>No matter what you are designing, you should have a main font. When it comes to web design, most likely this
			will
			be used in your title or headline text. It’s meant to be an accent, to stand out, and influence the mood of
			your
			design. It doesn’t really matter what type of font it is, but knowing the first one will help you choose
			your
			second.
			<br>
			Check out <a href="https://youtu.be/T5bnFdXSBRA" target="blank">this video</a> where Ran gives 3 tips to
			improve
			your typography.</p>

		<h3>Create Contrast With Your Second Font</h3>
		<p>Now that you have a main font for your design, the best way to choose a good secondary font is to make sure
			it’s
			dramatically different yet complements the design. You wouldn’t want to choose two serifs that look similar,
			there is no contrast and in fact, it looks like a design mistake. Take a look at this example, these are two
			different serif typefaces, but it’s difficult to tell.</p>

		<h3>Try Pairing Opposites</h3>
		<p>One of these ways to choose fonts is to choose a pair of opposites. A good example of this is to use a big
			and
			bold serif for your headline and a nice traditional serif typeface for the body copy. Take a look at this
			example, to see this tip in action.</p>

		<h3>Vary Width</h3>
		<p>Another tip is to think about the width of the typeface and how they complement each other. For example,
			maybe
			you want to pair a condensed sans serif typeface with a wider san serif. While they are both the same
			category
			of type, they vary in contrast due to their width. Take a look at this example for inspiration.</p>

		<h3>Consider Shape: Geometric Vs Organic</h3>
		<p>Typefaces can have geometric or organic attributes in their shape. One of the most well-known geometric
			typefaces
			is Futura, notice how open and round the O is in this poster design example.
			<br>
			In this example, the main headline uses a modern geometric sans serif typeface. This font choice helps
			establish
			the rest of the design, it pairs well with the other design elements.
		</p>

		<h3>Limit Your Design To 2-3 Typefaces</h3>
		<p>Just like choosing a color palette, it can be easy to get carried away with all the options available to use
			for
			your design. A good general rule is to stick to about 2–3 different typefaces total for a design. Now of
			course
			this might vary depending on what you are designing, but it’s a good rule of thumb.
			<br>
			For example, if you’re designing a logo you’ll most likely modify one main font and maybe use a secondary
			typeface. For a website or an app, you’ll likely want to follow the same rule.
		</p>
		<aside class="pull_quote">
			<p> When designing for digital screens, <b>legibility</b> and <b>accessibility</b> are key. </p>
		</aside>
		<p>
			Take a look at this poster designed for the Tribeca Film Festival. It’s a successful design for many reasons
			such as using scale with type, a good use of space, and hierarchy. But notice how they limited the design to
			three typefaces. The “CUT” and “TO” are two distinctly different bold serif typefaces. The first is thick
			and
			condensed while the second is still bold but wide. These are further paired well with a third monotype
			(think,
			typewriter) font for the main body copy with the fine details of the event. </p>

		<h3>Avoid Trendy Or Popular Typefaces</h3>
		<p>You want to choose typefaces that stand the test of time. Be wary of trendy or popular typefaces that you see
			everyone else using. If you choose something too niche or close to the times when designing a logo, for
			example,
			you’ll find yourself having to redesign it after a few short years. To avoid your design becoming outdated,
			include classic and well-known typefaces. Check out this fun article on <a
					href="https://blog.spoongraphics.co.uk/articles/25-classic-fonts-that-will-last-a-whole-design-career"
					target="blank">25 classic fonts that will last a whole design career.</a></p>

		<h3>Understand The Goal For This Design</h3>
		<p>If you’re designing a brand or a website for a client, are they in an industry where they need a lot of trust
			from their customer? For example, maybe it’s a banking app. Or are they trying to disrupt the space they are
			in?
			In the same example, maybe you’re creating a site for a cryptocurrency app. Yes they want to gain the trust
			of
			their potential customer, but they also want to stand out, maybe be a little more modern and bold to gain
			the
			attention and respect of a potential customer.
			<br>
			Understanding the intention behind the design will dictate your font choices. This is something Ran expands
			on
			in <a href="https://youtu.be/obZX8oIjia4" target="blank">this video on how to choose fonts.</a></p>
